        Once upon a time, in a fara-off land, there was a very lazy king who
        spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisers came to him
        with aproblem: the kingdom waas running our of money.
        <br />
        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
        leaving jokes all over the palace: under the king's pillow, in his soup,
        even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couln't seem to
        stop Jokester.
        <br />
        And then, one daay, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes
        left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And
        once they started laughing, they couln't stop.
